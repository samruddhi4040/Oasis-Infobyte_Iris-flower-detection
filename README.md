Iris flower has three species : Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, which differs according to their
measurements.                                                                                                             		                        
Now using the provided dataset, I checked the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species.                                               
My task here was to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.                                   
I've also added the dataset used by me for ready reference.       
The dataset was downloaded from www.kaggle.com
IDE used : Jupyter notebook
